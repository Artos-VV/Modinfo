## Community GUID ranges

[Ubisoft](https://anno-union.com/en/new-anno-union-history-edition-update-anno-afternoon/) has given us an official *safe* range in which we can safely choose new GUIDs! 

You can pick from the following *safe* GUID range: **1.337.471.142 - 2.147.483.647**

> Older Mods like *Spice it Up* will still use *older and unsafe* GUID ranges, but they will not be changed due to savegame compability. 

If you need help adding your range or want to talk, you can join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/KEVaVby)
